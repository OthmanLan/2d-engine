1. CPU utilization

game logic    \
physics step   | - > 16/33ms (60/30fps)
render step   /

2. Engine loop

User interaction -> Game logic -> (Positional logic, collision detection, collision resolution) -> render

Class Controller -> Game.js -> Class Engine -> Render

Class Controller: keys, pad detection 
Class Engine: position, collision detection and resolution
Class Model: core element

-------

M - model.js
V - game.js
C - engine.js
